# high_dimensional_statistics

Project for high dimensional statistics course.

In this project the objective was to try to understand food cultural differences between Italy and the US through the analysis of some famous recipes websites.
In order to do that, we scraped recipes from an italian and an american website and we constructed ingredients' coexistence graphs. Through the study of these graphs with generative graph models (AME latent space models in particular) and clustering some differences are detactable, like the italian's preference of not mixing in general sweet and savory ingredients together.
